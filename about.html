		<h1>Hey,</h1>
		I am Suraj. Welcome to my vlog page.<br> 
		I was wondering that knowledge I have learned in music and vedio creation,<br> why not share with others.<br>
		I've a good taste in every kind of music but soft and meledy songs are my priorities.<br>
		Apart from that i have a good knowledge on guitar's. Basically I am a Guitarist.<br> 
		So that's all about myself. <br>
		<br>

		Now coming to course. Here you'll learn about music notes(sargam), <br>how to identify scale of a song,<br>
		how to find key of song and some basics about <br>musical isntruments which will help you to find the key 
		or scale of the song.
